# Stew's Discord Bots Portfolio

## About me
Hello! My name is Max, but usually people call me Stew. I am a discord bot developer who does custom discord bots. Besides programming, I am fan of constantly growing Rocket League team communities, Overwatch and music. To contact me DM Stew#1902 (GMT+3). I answer fast! :)

## What do I offer?
I offer you creating an authentic, unique, fully-customizable Discord bot. That means:
* This bot will *only* work on *your* Discord server
* It will have **any** features you would like
* It will have name, profile picture, prefix or any other bot property that fits your server

My goal is to create bots that will make your servers a comfortable, easy to manage place where barely any moderation or management is required.
I don't want to make a bot that will create more problems on your server. Bot should be intuitive, fast and understandable to your commands.
I understand that different servers have different needs, that's why I let you pick features that will fit *exactly your* server. 
If you are uncertain what areas can bot optimize, I can help you pick right functionality.
When you decide on desired bot's functionality, I will start working on the bot. I will estimate ETA depending on the amount of work I need to do.

## Common concerns

### I can get scammed
It's hard for one person to prove they are not a scammer. I mentioned bots' owners and their discord server so you can contact them and ask them about my service, while seeing a working bot in action. If you ask them about bot price, I and every bot owner have an agreement that we don't disclose information like bot's token, bot's price of link to bot's files, so unfortunately you will not get a response. Also keep in mind that each bot's functionality is somewhat different so price may vary.

### Unverified bots can destroy my server. Untested bots can kick or ban every server member.
Depending on bot's functionality, it either 100% will not happen or will happen if one of the staff members will have malitious intents. In case of bot **being used as a tool of malicious actions** (and not bot himself doing wrong actions), I do not take any responsibility for the damage taken. Even though bots are often used to help you, if can also be used for bad actions. To prevent that from happening, certain actions are only allowed for server staff members, but if *they* do malicious actions, there is nothing I could have done.

### Bot's functionality may have bugs or it can be misinterpreted
I will fix any bugs you will find while using the bot, *but* I will not add any additional functionality to the bot. If you would like additional functionality, this will be counted as bot upgrade, and cost accordingly.

### I am not familiar with what discord bots are, how they work, what can they do.
Discord bots are the best features that Discord provides to make life in here more dynamic. Possibilities of a bot are endless, so (almost) anything is possible. From analyzing messages to music bots, from role giving to image processing.

Bots make life for usual users and for server owners much easier: casual users can interact with a bot and have fun while making your server more active. Server owners, however, get a tool that can take immediate actions to make the server safe and fun place for everyone. Most of the actions that moderators take can be very easily automated by the bot: preventing users from sending swear words, spamming, sending content to inappropriate channels, and honestly possibilities are endless if you think about it!

### Moderators are way smarter than bots. If I already have moderators, why would I need a bot?
I can guarantee you that up to 90% of moderation your staff does can be automated. Moderators often do repetitive, easy tasks: check if no one typed any offensive words, that no one was spamming, messages are sent in correct channels and so on. If you think about it, all of this tasks are so easy, that they can be easily automated; so repetitive, that bot can execute something every time something happens on the server (message is sent, user joins etc.); so time consuming, that bots can do it all in matter of milliseconds; so boring, because of that a senseless machine can do it 24/7 for years. See, moderators are an insignificantly better version of the bots, but why deal with people that have just a few small advantages over a machine, that are not always online, that may understand your requirements incorrectly, than with a bot who does everything you say to it all day and all night long? I don't say that you should not have any human moderation on the server, I just give you a perspective on mods' tasks in general and how easily they can be optimized if bot's functionality is set correctly. Personally I am so sure of moderation on my servers, that I gave my bots all the privileges for being a full moderator. Now, these servers barely need any moderation. Admit that a program that captures all server events instantly and takes according actions in less than a second is much more advantageous over any moderator, even the most active, loyal and experienced mod.

## Bots that I've made
Here you can find all bots that I have done for my clients' Discord server and their information. Work in Progress means that bot is not yet on the server, is not fully functional or is offline until further notice.
