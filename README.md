# Stew's Discord Bots Portfolio

## About me
Hello! My name is Max, but usually people call me Stew. I am a discord bot developer who does custom discord bots. That means:
* This bot will only work on desired Discord server
* It will have **any** features you would like
* It will have name, profile picture, prefix or any other bot property that fits your server
Besides programming, I am fan of constantly growing Rocket League team communities, Overwatch and music. To contact me DM Stew#1902 (GMT+3). I answer fast! :)
